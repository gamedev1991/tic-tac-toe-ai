## Architecture Overview

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with Next.js and uses a component-based architecture with React Context for state management.

#### Key Components:
1. **Board Component**
   - Manages the game grid
   - Handles click events
   - Displays game pieces (X/O)
   - Shows winning line

2. **Game Component**
   - Controls game flow
   - Manages turn state
   - Handles win detection
   - Controls game reset

3. **Menu Component**
   - Mode selection interface
   - Room creation/joining for multiplayer
   - Game settings

#### State Management:
1. **GameContext**
   - Game state (board, current player, winner)
   - Game mode
   - AI difficulty level
   - Win detection logic

2. **SocketContext**
   - WebSocket connection management
   - Room management
   - Real-time game state sync
   - Player connection status

### Backend Architecture

The backend uses Node.js with Socket.io for real-time communication.

#### Server Components:
1. **Socket Manager**
   - Handles WebSocket connections
   - Manages game rooms
   - Broadcasts game state updates

2. **Game Logic**
   - Validates moves
   - Checks win conditions
   - Manages game state

#### WebSocket Events:
1. **Room Events**
   - `game:create`: Create new game room
   - `game:join`: Join existing room
   - `game:leave`: Leave current room

2. **Game Events**
   - `move:made`: Player made a move
   - `game:reset`: Reset game state
   - `game:over`: Game ended

3. **Connection Events**
   - `connect`: New player connection
   - `disconnect`: Player disconnection
   - `playerLeft`: Opponent left game

## AI Implementation

The AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm with the following features:

1. **Difficulty Levels**
   - Easy: Random moves
   - Medium: Mix of random and optimal moves
   - Hard: Optimal moves using Minimax

2. **Minimax Algorithm**
   - Depth-first search of game tree
   - Evaluation of board positions
   - Alpha-beta pruning for optimization

## Data Flow

1. **Local Game Flow**
   ```
   User Click → Board Component → Game Context → State Update → UI Update
   ```

2. **Online Game Flow**
   ```
   User Click → Board Component → Socket Context → Server 
   → Other Player's Socket → Other Player's Game State → UI Update
   ```

3. **AI Game Flow**
   ```
   User Click → Board Component → Game Context → AI Algorithm 
   → AI Move → Game Context → UI Update
   ```

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**
   - Move validation on both client and server
   - Room ID validation
   - Player turn validation

2. **Connection Security**
   - Unique socket IDs
   - Room-based access control
   - Disconnection handling

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Frontend**
   - React memo for expensive components
   - Optimized re-renders
   - Lazy loading for game modes

2. **Backend**
   - Efficient room management
   - Optimized game state updates
   - Memory cleanup for ended games

## Error Handling

1. **Client-side**
   - Connection error recovery
   - Invalid move handling
   - UI error boundaries

2. **Server-side**
   - Room management errors
   - Invalid game state handling
   - Connection timeout handling
