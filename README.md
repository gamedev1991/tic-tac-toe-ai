## Game Rules

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid
2. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O)
3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
4. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw

## AI Implementation

The AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm to make decisions:
- Evaluates all possible moves
- Considers future game states
- Chooses the optimal move to either win or prevent the player from winning
